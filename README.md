# Crowdfunding_ETL

Creates an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods  to extract and transform the data. Afterwards, four CSV files were created and used  to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally,  the CSV file data was uploaded into a Postgres database.

The Four Subsections
1. Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Campaign DataFrame
3. Contacts DataFrame
***Note: Both ETL_Mini_Project_Starters are the same, but we ran into some issues viewing one, so ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code might work better.***
4. Crowdfunding Database

All the CSVs' and ERD will be in the resources folder
